# crazy-eights-vb6.0

A school project to make a card game

Personally made Crazy Eights (Currently working as of last checked)

written in VB 6.0

Contains the project and resource files, as well as a .exe if one so wants to run it themselves (note that your antivirus might think that it is some malware, but I'm pretty that's just becuase VB6.0 is too old)
